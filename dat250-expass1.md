## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1 Report
There were no technical problems during the installation of any of the software. 
I already had an updated JDK and IDE (IntelliJ), so i only had to download and install Maven and the Git client. 

I have used IntelliJ for quite som time, so i am confident it works the way it should.
As for the JDK, Maven and Git, i looked up various tutorials and double checked if everything was behaving as expected.

## Problems
For the most part the Heroku tutorial was pretty straight forward, but my lack of experience in using enviorment variables and paths did make me have to research some extra things.
For example, some commands would simply not work because i had added the wrong path, or in some cases it was not added at all. Even when adding the correct paths, most of the commands would not work before i restarted my computer.
The most likely reason for this is that the Heroku application was still running while i was changing paths. It did not take me very long to figure it out though,
and after a little while everything worked as it said it should in the tutorial.
